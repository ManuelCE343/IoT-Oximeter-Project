# IoT-Oximeter-Project
This project proposes using an ESP32 to capture data from a MAX30102 sensor to measure blood oxygen saturation and body temperature, along with geolocation to determine the user's condition and position using a GPS module. All this is integrated into a wearable bracelet that displays the data on an LCD screen.
